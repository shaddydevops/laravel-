Debugging Documentation: MySQL Container Configuration Issues
Initial Problem
The MySQL container was failing to start with the error:
Debugging Steps
1. Initial Investigation
Identified that environment variables were being pulled from AWS Secrets Manager
Found that DB_USERNAME was set to "root" in the secrets
MySQL container doesn't allow using "root" as MYSQL_USER
2. First Attempt - Hardcoded Values
Result: Still failed because AWS secrets were overriding these values
3. Second Attempt - Mixed Approach
Result: Still encountered issues with credential consistency
4. Final Solution
Updated AWS Secrets Manager with correct values:
Modified docker-compose.yml to use proper environment variable format:
Updated deployment script to use AWS secrets consistently:
Success Indicators
MySQL container starts successfully
Database and user created correctly
All containers (Laravel, Frontend, phpMyAdmin) start properly
Container health checks pass
Key Learnings
1. MySQL container has specific requirements for user configuration
Root user must be configured separately from regular users
3. Environment variables in docker-compose.yml need proper formatting
Consistency between AWS secrets and container configuration is crucial
Current Status
✅ All services running properly
✅ Database initialized correctly
✅ User permissions set correctly
✅ Container health checks passing
